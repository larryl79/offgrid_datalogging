# offgrid_datalogging
I'm using a Arduino mega+ESP 01(wifi), to implement data logging acquiring data from my solar inverter and  in a near future 16 temperature sensors for monitoring each lead acid battery temperature.  My plans: Arduino will concentrate all data acquisition and send to a raspberry pi 3 running a webserver+PHP+mariaDB for dashboard. Still thinking on a cloud server to make a cell phone communication easier....
